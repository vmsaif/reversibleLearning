# Vision Statement
<p>Our group plans to create a mobile application that anyone can use to write questions and answers to flashcards. Eventually, users can use their flashcards for various purposes, such as studying while they are in their schooling years, or when their scholastic years are behind them but are interested in brushing up their knowledge. By storing personal questions on the app, we can create a place to archive the knowledge individuals have acquired throughout their entire life.</p>

<p>Our mobile application will create a convenient environment where users who are interested in learning will feel comfortable learning no matter how old they are. While attending school, the app will be a helpful study aide, and once they have graduated, it will be a refreshing reminder of the things they have learned. Therefore, while our target is predominantly students, we truly believe anyone will be able to use our app. However, because we store information on our app, individuals under the age of 13 will need parental supervision/permission.</p>

<p>To better aid the students on our app, we also plan on letting users create their own custom tests with their questions. The app will also provide an option to set a timer for their custom tests. This feature will help students who use our app to practice the skills that allow them to succeed in taking tests throughout their schooling.</p>

<p>Finally, we plan on building a social aspect into the app. The ability to connect socially will allow students to ‘compete’ with their friends and the people around them and create a driving sense combined with increased motivation to continue learning. Knowing others around you are learning and practicing the same problems as you creates the sense of a competitive, studious environment, which should drive people to continue using the app.</p>

<p>Everyone learns throughout their schooling career; some people need extra help to finish schooling, while others desire to learn well after school. Physical notes can take up a lot of space, but with an app like the one we have in mind, it will be easy to keep track of your learning throughout your entire schooling career. With this easy storage for all a person’s notes and flashcards, it will be easier than ever to brush up the knowledge learned in school while providing a comfortable environment to continue learning late into life, taking learning with them the entire way.</p>

<p>Our Project will be considered successful based on three criteria. First, we will conduct an optional poll to measure the increase in our user's scholarly grades by individual report. Secondly, if we are getting any of our post-graduated users, determined again by user poll, we will know our app has appeal for lifelong learning. Finally, if thirty percent of our users return to the app at least once a day, we will consider our app a success.</p>

# Branching Strategy
<p>GitHub Branching Strategy</p>

1. Pull 'master' to your computer to get the newest version

2. Make a new branch, from master with the name of the new feature you are working on

3. Once done, push your branch and open a pull request

4. Get 1-2 teammate to approve/ reject and discuss the code

5. Make changes as necessary 

6. After teammates approve, open a merge request to master

7. At this point your local branch can be deleted and you can pull master again.
