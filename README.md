**Reversible Learning** is a comprehensive study application tailored for students and lifelong learners. It's designed to assist users in organizing class notes across multiple subjects, archiving past questions, and ensuring that knowledge remains accessible for future reference.

### Features
- **Organize Notes**: Create, edit, and organize notes for as many classes or subjects as you need.
- **Archive Questions**: Store past questions and answers, making revision more efficient.
- **Flashcards**: Use the built-in flashcard system to test your knowledge and improve memory retention.
- **Custom Tests**: Create custom tests from your flashcards, with optional timers to simulate exam conditions.

### How It Works
Reversible Learning operates on a three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Tier**: This is the user interface layer where users interact with the application. It displays information and collects user inputs.
2. **Logic Tier**: This layer processes the information collected in the presentation tier, handling the business logic of the application.
3. **Data Tier**: Responsible for storing and managing the application's data. It utilizes HSQLDB for persistent data storage.
