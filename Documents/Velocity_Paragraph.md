In iteration 1, we were not quite sure what we could get done or how long it would take us to create an app.\
Then, in iteration 2, we really focused on what we could complete and made sure we completed all the work we promised to finish, so all our user stories were completed.\
In iteration 3, our focus was mainly on the testing framework, so while we did focus on a few features, with a few user stories, some implementation was pushed back because we had so many individuals on testing, leaving us with less working hours on the new features and user stories.
